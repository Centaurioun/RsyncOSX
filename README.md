I am the developer of some GUIÂ´s for `rsync` on the Apple macOS plattform.

**RsyncOSX version 6.5.8** is released for macOS Catalina 10.15 and later versions of macOS.

**RsyncOSX version 6.6.0** is released for **macOS Big Sur** only. The major work in this release is integrating Combine. Due to requirements of some features in Combine, version 6.6.0 is build for **macOS Big Sur** only. See [the Combine part](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/blob/master/RsyncOSX.md#Combine) in the readme for RsyncOSX.

**RsyncUI** which are released for macOS Big Sur and later versions of macOS.

The released version of RsyncUI still need some more work on the details. There is a lot to learn about the new version of Swift, SwiftUI and macOS 12. RsyncUI is stabel and it works. But some parts of the UI and how it works still need some more polish. I am learning more about SwiftUI every day and the challenge for me is to learn about the built in API and use the most of it. And that takes some time. But there is every day some enhancements in the code.

And there are a few significant changes in SwiftUI and macOS 12 which makes RsyncUI a more user friendly application. The downside is there will be no release until the final version of Xcode 13 and macOS 12 is here.

So, if you download RsyncUI and start using it please have this in mind. And as always, please report back if there something to dislike or request for new features.
